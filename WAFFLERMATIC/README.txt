Welcome to your newest adorable timesuck: Wafflermatic.

Wafflermatic is a javascript based game where the user chooses if they like or don't like an image until they filter down through to a "game over" message.  At the end of the game the loop starts all over again.

A simple game based on an array, this was my first project using any javascript.  As with jscalendar, I had much help from Peter Kamali on this project on how to make this work, but the concept was mine and I did all the rest.

There are a couple of bugs in this, mostly because of camel casing.  Otherwise everything is correct.

Enjoy Wafflermatic, I know I did!
